# Rice Games Internship
## Description of Organization and Population Served: 
Rice Games is a brand new indie game studio filled with entrepreneurial spirits that are looking to design and create video games that change the industry. Founded in September 2018, Rice Games is a lean startup that may still be in its infancy, but is looking to enthrall core gamers and language learners alike through their first project, Shujinkou.

## Description of Project Work and Responsibilities of Intern: 
Interns will be able to gain skills in this unique dual internship, spending odd weeks learning about entrepreneurial marketing and social media data analysis, and spending even weeks working on small, but complex video game projects that will help develop a mind for game logic, proper design, and clean and efficient programming. The final will be a multipage single-spaced essay that will consist of research on appealing and creating new markets, as well as portions on efficient programming and the steps behind designing a fun to play video game.

## Repository Layout:
This repository is broken into folders for each week of the program. Sessions with M in their name are focused on the entrepreneurial aspects of the internship and contain a PDF with learnings from the week, while sessions with P in their name include the code written to learn different programming concepts. The final report PDF is a reflection on different parts of the internship, an evaluation of Rice Games's business model, and an analysis of Shujinkou's audience.
