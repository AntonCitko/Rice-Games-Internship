## Right Road, Wrong Road

In this game, the player is chasing a demon that is trying to eat the humans in a nearby town. Each turn, the user encounters a fork in the road and must choose the same way as the monster without any knowledge of which way the monster went. The monsters choice is always random. If the user selects incorrectly, a human is eaten, that is, the player loses a life. The player only has five lives, so choose carefully.

Below is scoring scheme:

| Turns Alive | Score |
|-------------|-------|
| 20+         | S     |
| 15-19       | A     |
| 12-14       | B     |
| 10-11       | C     |
| 6-9         | D     |
| 5           | F     |

Good luck!
